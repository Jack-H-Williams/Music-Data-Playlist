# Music-Data-Project 
**Independent Project â€“ Summer 2025**  
**Author:** Jack Williams  

### Overview  
A terminal-based music playlist manager built with C++.  
Implements a **doubly linked list** to store and navigate song nodes. It supports adding, removing, skipping, looping, and shuffling functionality.  

I developed this project independently to deepen my understanding of data structures, memory management, and the Rule of Three in C++.
